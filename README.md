## _A Simple C RESTful Webserver_

The purpose of the project is to provide a simple interface in C for developing REST APIs using a low-level language, which in the future will have integration with databases (Riak, Mongo and other).

To guarantee this, we use the __GNU libmicrohttpd__ that gives us an incredible performance and support for IPv6 and other features.

### Our Philosophy

We at __Appzlab__, we aim the elegance and quality of code, so there are ways to optimize the code, but there will probably be a loss of elegance and ease of use. We also believe in a more opensource and accessible to all.
